# Siyagah — build log

Every round, oldest first. **This file is history, not the brief** —
`CLAUDE.md` is what every session reads. Come here only when you need the
background of one particular feature: why a decision was taken, what a round
measured, what it deliberately left undone.

The five most recent rounds are also kept in `CLAUDE.md`, so recent context
needs no trip here. **Never let history accumulate in `CLAUDE.md` instead of
here** — the brief has to stay short enough to read at the start of every
session.

## Before the log existed (v03.x → v04.05)

Reconstructed from git commit messages on 4 September 2026, when this file was
opened. These entries are one line each because that is genuinely all the
record there is — no round-by-round log was kept before this date, and nothing
below was written at the time. Treat them as a table of contents into
`git log`, not as an account of what any round measured or decided.

The repo starts 27 July 2026 as a series of "Add files via upload" commits —
whole-file drops of `index.html` from outside git. Real per-change commits
begin 14 August 2026.

**Sync hardening (14–27 Aug 2026).** Cross-platform latency and truncated note
uploads; remote edits being discarded by an open editor; sync depending solely
on the realtime listener (a reconcile poll was added under it); title-only
edits never syncing and no-op saves winning merges; sync silently reporting
success on real Firestore failures.

**Storage (28 Aug 2026).** Note History was storing a full copy of each note's
content — embedded base64 images and all — in every snapshot, so one photo
could be duplicated up to 40 times per note and then faithfully synced to every
device. That is the root cause of the "browser storage is full" reports.
Snapshots are now image-free, with a one-time migration to strip what was
already stored.

**The folder pop-out (28 Aug – 3 Sep 2026, v03.9x–v04.03).** The "Assign to
folders" popup grew into a real Folder Browser: resizable, draggable by its
title bar, note titles as editable/movable leaves under each folder, Pane-1
sections popping into the same window, a section navigator in its title bar,
prev/next, Smart Views / Tags / Note Types in the same nav, global search,
remembered scope and size, an "All Sections" view, and a full-screen variant
on tablet and phone.

**v04.00** (2 Sep) New Note opens in a screen-proportionate pop-out window.
**v04.01** (2 Sep) v03.99 sealed as a frozen Legacy App under `/legacy/`,
reachable from the 🏠 menu. **v04.02** (2 Sep) automatic dated backups of the
whole app + notes, via the File System Access API. **v04.03** (3 Sep) folder
text styling in the pop-out browser. **v04.04** (4 Sep) note templates,
starting with Jumu'a Khutbah. **v04.05** (4 Sep) the web app manifest and real
icons, which had been missing.

`CLAUDE.md` was first added 4 September 2026 (between v04.04 and v04.05),
carrying the version rule and the `legacy/**` freeze.

## v04.06 — 4 September 2026 · the brief, the log, and something that measures

**Round 1 of working this way.** No app behaviour changed. This round set the
repo up so that every later round has a short brief to read, a place to write
history that is not the brief, and a way to *measure* instead of guessing.

**What was built**

- **`CLAUDE.md` rewritten** as a standing brief: what Siyagah is, that the
  owner is a non-coder, how to work, the invariants, terminology, the
  decisions confirmed this round, an empty "Standing lessons" section, and the
  five most recent rounds. Small enough to read every session.
- **This file**, with the pre-existing history reconstructed from `git log` and
  labelled as reconstructed.
- **`tools/`** — the measuring tool this app did not have. `harness.mjs` boots
  the real app in Chromium with Firebase blocked; `ship-check.mjs` (no browser,
  ~1s) checks the version in all three places, the `nd` data tag, every
  `sw.js` `CORE` path, every manifest icon's real pixel size, and that
  `legacy/**` is untouched; `app-check.mjs` (33 checks) drives the booted app;
  `probe.mjs` dumps what a pane really renders; `shot.mjs` screenshots at
  phone, tablet and desktop. `tools/README.md` explains all of it and carries
  the harness's own traps.
- **`.gitignore`** for `tools/shots/` and `node_modules/`.

**What it measured, first run**

33/33 in `app-check`, 11/11 in `ship-check`, against v04.05 as it stands on
`main`. Nothing was found broken. Notable numbers, as a baseline for later
rounds: **442** inline event handlers, all resolving to real functions; **11**
Smart Views, all rendering; a Save File export of **1037 KB** that round-trips
every folder and note id; Chromium reporting the manifest clean and the app
installable; no sideways scroll and no collapsed pane at 390×844, 820×1180 or
1440×900.

**Confirmed by the owner this round**

Single user, one Google account. The four things that must never break:
notes are never lost or silently changed *except by the owner's own deliberate
deletion*; cross-device sync keeps working; it works offline and as an
installed app; a downloaded copy still opens years later. Screen sizes and
which past breakages to prioritise were left to Claude's judgement — all three
sizes and all four risk areas are covered, since each was cheap.

**What was NOT done, and why**

- **"Standing lessons" is empty**, as asked. Five real traps *were* learned
  building the harness this round, but they are harness traps, so they are
  written in `tools/README.md` where the next person touching the harness will
  actually be standing. The section is reserved for lessons about the *app*.
- **No check covers Firestore itself.** Sync is measured through `mergeDB()`,
  which is the part that decides what survives a merge; the network round-trip
  to a real Firebase project is not exercised and cannot be from a sandbox.
- **No check opens a saved `file://` copy.** "A downloaded copy still opens
  years later" is only measured as far as "the export contains the whole app
  and every note" — actually launching an exported file from disk is a gap,
  and a candidate for round 2.
- **No check covers the float-window editor (`.fw-ed`).** Only Pane 3's `#ed`
  is driven. Anything on the edit toolbar has to be added in both places, so
  this is a real coverage hole.
- **`legacy/**` was not touched**, by rule.

## v04.07 — a line to write on, above and below the note (10 September 2026)

Two places in every note had no caret you could reach. The owner reported both
with a marked-up screenshot: a red bar above the first heading, and another
below the last one.

**What was actually wrong**

Measured in a real browser before anything was changed, on a note shaped like
the one in the screenshot — heading, text, heading:

- **Above.** A note that opens with a heading has nothing in front of it to
  click into. A click in the space above it did not do nothing; it landed the
  caret at *offset 1 of the `<h2>`* — **between the fold grip `⠿` and the fold
  arrow `▼`** — so typing went in among the heading's own chrome.
- **Below.** A click anywhere in the empty space under the last block put the
  caret at the **end of that block**. On a note ending in a heading, typing
  there carried on the heading, in heading style, instead of starting a new
  line. On desktop that dead space was 515px tall.
- **The existing escape hatch was broken.** v03.67.01 had added a rule: press
  Enter at the very start of the note's first heading and get an empty
  paragraph above it. It tested the caret with `pre.toString()`, which counts
  the grip and the arrow as two characters — so once `_edColInit()` started
  injecting that chrome into every heading, the rule could never fire. What
  happened instead was worse than nothing: Enter split the heading, leaving a
  **stray chrome-only heading** `⠿▼` behind, which then sprouted its own fold
  arrow and TOC entry. Nobody had noticed because the feature simply appeared
  not to work.

**What now happens**

Clicking the empty band above the first block, or below the last one, opens a
real empty line there and puts the caret in it. Typing at a heading's left
edge writes at the front of the title instead of inside the chrome. The Enter
rule works again, on lists and headings alike.

Details that took the measuring to get right:

- That empty space is the editor's own padding and its leftover height, so a
  click there lands on the editor element itself — for the top, the bottom
  **and the sides** alike. Only the top and bottom bands act. Beside a block
  the browser is already right, and is left alone.
- A note that **starts with a plain paragraph** is left to the browser too: the
  caret already lands at the start of that paragraph, and inserting a line
  there would be an unasked-for edit.
- An empty paragraph already sitting at the edge **is** the line to write on,
  so the gutter can be clicked any number of times without stacking blank
  lines.
- If the note **ends inside a collapsed section**, that section is opened
  first. Otherwise the new line is a sibling of hidden content and the next
  `_edColApply()` would hide it again — the owner would have been typing into
  a line that vanished on the next render.
- Bound on `click`, not `mousedown`, so a drag that starts in the gutter to
  select text still selects text.
- Delegated from `document`, so Pane 3's `#ed` and every float window's
  `.fw-ed` get one implementation — the E5 rule. **The float window is covered
  by this round**, which closes part of the coverage hole v04.06 recorded.
- Nothing in this path calls `_edTouched()`. Opening a line and walking away
  without typing must not dirty the note on its own; the moment anything is
  typed, the editor's existing autosave commits the line with the text.

**Measured**

11/11 ship checks, and app checks up from 33 to **40** — seven new ones, all
driving real mouse clicks, since the caret is real browser state:

- clicking below the last block opens a new line, not the end of the heading;
- clicking beside a block adds nothing;
- clicking above a leading heading opens a line in front of it;
- a note starting with a paragraph is left to the browser;
- Enter at the start of the first heading writes above it, not into it, and
  leaves no chrome-only heading behind;
- typing at a heading's left edge writes at the front of the title, chrome
  intact;
- opening a line without typing leaves the note untouched in `DB`.

Verified separately at all three sizes (390×844, 820×1180, 1440×900) and in a
float window; the saved content carries no chrome.

**A harness trap this round paid for**

A debounced autosave **outlives the editor that armed it**. Typing arms a timer
of up to `_ED_AUTOSAVE_MAX_MS` (2.5s); `renderP3C()` then builds a brand-new
`#ed`, but the old timer still fires and commits whatever `#ed` holds at that
moment. The "a bare click does not save" check failed on exactly this — it was
measuring the *previous* check's keystrokes, in code that was fine. Written up
in `tools/README.md`.

**What was NOT done, and why**

- **No sanitiser, no content migration.** Existing notes are untouched; this
  round only changes where a click puts the caret.
- **The stray `⠿▼` headings already sitting in saved notes are not cleaned up.**
  If the broken Enter rule created any before today, they are still there. A
  migration that deletes headings is exactly the kind of thing invariant I1
  forbids doing on a guess, and an empty heading is harmless — it can be
  deleted by hand. Say the word and it can be done as its own round, with a
  backup of what it removes.
- **Lists were left with the browser's own behaviour above them.** The C8 Enter
  rule already covers writing above a leading list; a gutter click above one
  now opens a line too, but nothing else about lists was touched.
- **`legacy/**` was not touched**, by rule.
